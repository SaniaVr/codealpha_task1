# codealpha_task1
Personal Portfolio website by Sania Verma


Hey viewer!
I am Sania Verma and this is my Personal Portfolio website. I have made this website an internship project for Code-Alpha. I am really grateful for this opportunity and would like to extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude towards team Code-Alpha.
This website tells you about myself like my basic info, educational background, extracurricular involvement, etc. I was able to build this project using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I took inspiration from Sowndhar's personal portfolio website and I'm glad for all the help.


This is  my very first project, hope you like it <3
